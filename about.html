            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to shadow at a hospital in Bangalore, where I witnessed firsthand the harsh realities of cancer treatment. Patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation suffered from severe side effects, and it became evident that the treatments themselves were contributing significantly to their discomfort. During my time there, I met a doctor who specialized in vitamin C therapy, aiming to strengthen patients' immune systems by injecting high doses of vitamin C. This approach showed promising results, with fewer side effects compared to the conventional treatments I had observed earlier. This experience ignited my passion for exploring more effective and less harmful methods of cancer treatment, particularly through the use of targeted therapies that deliver inhibitors directly to cancer cells.</p>
